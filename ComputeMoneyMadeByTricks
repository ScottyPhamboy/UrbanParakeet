//Description: In this program, user will input the number of cartwheel, handstand, roll, and walkover. 
//             Each moves has their own set values so it will compute data given by user for four 
//             weeks and computes the amount made in those four weeks. It would also compute 
//             average in a week and potential amount in a year assuming a 
//             year consist of 35 weeks.
